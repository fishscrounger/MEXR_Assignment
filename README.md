Simple 'Fruit Ninja' health-oriented VR clone. C

Unity Version: 2021.3.16f1 LTS

Aim: Design and implement a Unity app containing a single mini game / movement exercise that incentivizes the user to bend and reach with his/her arms.

The aim was met by creating a game based on 'Fruit Ninja', where the user bends and stretches to reach food flying towards them. Using swords attached to the VR controllers, the user swings their arms to cut the food, cuasing it to fall to the ground and gain points.

The thought behind this design was that the user can move to reach food, as it spawns randomly over a wider area and strecht and swing their arms to cut the food. As well as this, additional health-oriented and motivational tips appear on the screen (i.e., "You can do this! Another step on the road to recovery") during the game to further motivate the user.

The UI can be greatly improved, as it is in such a simple form as it stands but more focus was placed on the actual gameplay design.
