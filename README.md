# MEXR_Assignment

Simple 'Fruit Ninja' health-oriented VR clone. Converted to non-VR 3D.

Unity Version: 2021.3.16f1 LTS

Aim: Design and implement a Unity app containing a single mini game / movement exercise that incentivizes the user to bend and reach with his/her arms.

This application allows a user to cut food flying towards them with a sword, controlled using their mouse or the right analogue stick on a controller. The camera is moved using WASD, arrow keys, or the left analog stick on a controller.
